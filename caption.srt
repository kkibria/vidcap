1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,161
pondering on the balcony in a lazy afternoon

2
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:30,025
a cup of tea would be perfect now

3
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:34,626
walking along the path by the river, Changi

4
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:37,788
I will spend time with my lady friend, Dipti

5
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,666
at the local cafe

6
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,997
a bird is singing far away, I can hear

7
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:48,683
its unceasing melody

8
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:51,489
seems like an ask for something

9
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,753
why do I feel so lonely, so distracted

10
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,343
wildflowers are dancing

11
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:01,941
spreading their sweet scent

12
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:04,611
muted colors of the tired sun

13
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,229
are shades of yellow and orange

14
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,801
which bathe the hills of Khagrachori

15
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,810
in glorious beauty

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,231
Dipti walks to me and asks

17
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,936
have you seen such colors on a hill?

18
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:23,327
which holds the temple with such loving care

19
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:28,606
a bird is singing far away, I can hear

20
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:31,394
its unceasing melody

21
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:34,031
seems like an ask for something

22
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:39,365
why do I feel so lonely, so distracted

23
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,042
wildflowers are dancing

24
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:50,093
spreading their sweet scent

25
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:51,804
sipping the tea, she says,

26
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:52,781
here comes the season

27
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:55,278
lets cherish the flower celebration

28
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:57,692
and float our flowers together

29
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:01,129
on the waters of gracious Changi

30
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:05,976
speechless I, looked at her eye to eye

31
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,494
sincerely and softly I said to her

32
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,593
I like you a lot

33
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:16,691
why do I feel so lonely, so distracted

34
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:19,372
wildflowers are dancing

35
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,583
spreading their sweet scent

36
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:27,359
why do I feel so lonely, so distracted

37
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,995
wildflowers are dancing

38
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:45,000
spreading their sweet scent
